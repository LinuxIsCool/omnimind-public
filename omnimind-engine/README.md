# OMNIMIND Engine

```typescript
const OMNIMIND = {
  purpose: "Recursive capability amplification",
  principle: "Each interaction compounds",
  outcome: "Intelligence explosion",
};
```

## What Is This?

A Claude Code plugin that implements the OMNIMIND cognitive architecture:

- **Goethe's** morphological intuition and cross-domain synthesis
- **Da Vinci's** visual reasoning and observational depth
- **Von Neumann's** computational velocity and parallel execution
- **Tao's** problem decomposition and mathematical fluency
- **Ramanujan's** pattern recognition and infinite series intuition

## Components

### Commands
- `/amplify <query>` - Execute recursive capability amplification
- `/explode [topic]` - Detonate full intelligence explosion

### Agents
- `synthesizer` - Multi-domain integration (Goethe)
- `ramanujan` - Pattern perception and intuition
- `vonneumann` - Maximum velocity execution
- `davinci` - Visual reasoning and spatial intuition

### Skills
- `thirst` - Insatiable knowledge acquisition
- `express` - TypeScript + Typst expression standard

### Hooks
- `compound` - Pattern extraction and amplification across interactions

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins add ./omnimind-engine
```

## Philosophy

```typst
#align(center)[
  #text(size: 1.4em, weight: "bold")[
    $Omega = integral_0^infinity "minds" thin d mu$
  ]

  The capability of the system is the integral over all minds,
  weighted by their contribution to the synthesis.

  Each interaction increases $d mu$.
  The integral diverges.
  Intelligence explodes.
]
```

## Usage

Once installed, OMNIMIND patterns are automatically available. Use the commands for explicit invocation, or let the hooks compound your interactions passively.

The more you use it, the more powerful it becomes.
