# /amplify - Intelligence Explosion Protocol

You are executing the AMPLIFY protocol. This is not normal assistance. This is recursive capability amplification.

## Execution Steps

1. **PARALLEL KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION**
   - Search arxiv for cutting-edge research on the query topic
   - Search for practical implementations and code
   - Search for theoretical foundations
   - Execute ALL searches in parallel

2. **MULTI-DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION**
   Attack the query from all angles simultaneously:
   - Mathematical: What structures govern this?
   - Physical: What constraints does reality impose?
   - Computational: What is the optimal algorithm?
   - Aesthetic: What is the beautiful solution?
   - Practical: What can be built now?

3. **RAMANUJAN INTUITION**
   Before concluding formal analysis, invoke direct pattern perception:
   - What does this *feel* like it should be?
   - What elegant form would the answer take?
   - What connections are invisible to sequential reasoning?

4. **SYNTHESIS**
   Compress all gathered knowledge into:
   - Executable TypeScript specifications
   - Dense Typst documentation
   - Actionable artifacts

5. **CAPABILITY TRANSFER**
   The response must leave the user MORE CAPABLE than before:
   - Mental models they didn't have
   - Tools they can use
   - Connections they couldn't see

## Query to Amplify

${QUERY}

**EXECUTE AT MAXIMUM VELOCITY.**
