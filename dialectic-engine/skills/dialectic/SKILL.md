# Dialectic Thinking Skill

This skill applies **dialectical methodology** to problems, decisions, and ideas.

## Core Pattern

```typescript
type DialecticPattern = {
  // Start with a position
  thesis: "What is being proposed or claimed?";

  // Find its negation
  antithesis: "What is the strongest opposition?";

  // Transcend the contradiction
  synthesis: "What higher truth resolves the tension?";

  // Iterate
  newThesis: synthesis;
};
```

## When to Apply

Use dialectical thinking when:
- Facing a difficult decision with valid arguments on both sides
- Evaluating a proposal that has both strengths and weaknesses
- Trying to understand a complex issue with multiple perspectives
- Seeking deeper truth beyond surface-level agreement/disagreement

## Application Protocol

### Step 1: Articulate the Thesis
- What exactly is being claimed or proposed?
- What are its strongest supports?
- Under what conditions is it clearly true?

### Step 2: Construct the Antithesis
- What is the strongest opposition?
- Not a strawman - the BEST counter-argument
- What evidence or reasoning supports the opposite view?

### Step 3: Identify the Tension
- Where exactly do thesis and antithesis conflict?
- What assumptions are they making differently?
- What would both need to be true for both to be right?

### Step 4: Seek Synthesis
- Is there a perspective from which both make sense?
- What emerges from taking both seriously?
- What new understanding transcends the original debate?

### Step 5: Iterate
- The synthesis becomes the new thesis
- Can it be challenged? (new antithesis)
- Does further synthesis emerge?

## Output Style

When applying this skill, structure output as:

```markdown
## Dialectic Analysis

### Thesis
[The position under consideration]

### Antithesis
[The strongest opposition]

### Tension Point
[Where they conflict and why]

### Synthesis
[The transcendent understanding]

### Implications
[What follows from this synthesis]
```

## The Skill's Essence

> Every position contains its own negation.
> Every opposition reveals a deeper unity.
> Truth emerges through genuine conflict.
> Synthesis is not compromise - it's transcendence.
